### How it works
Each topic has a task. Complete it using **your own project**, or use the guided project spec if you're unsure what to build.

### ✅ Submit Criteria

When you're done, you should be able to show all of the following:

**API related**
| # | What to show |
|---|---|
| 1 | A running API with the 3 booking endpoints — demo via curl or Postman |
| 2 | A CORS demo — one request blocked, one allowed, explain why |
| 3 | A working TypeScript client or CLI that calls your API — no `any`, typed req/res |
| 4 | Test output showing green for happy path, 409, and 400 cases |
| 5 | Your API and frontend run as systemd services on a Linux VM, accessible over HTTPS — share the public URL, show `systemctl status` output, and include your systemd `.service` config files in your repo |

**Standalone**
| # | What to show |
|---|---|
| 6 | A shell script that reads `bookings.psv`, processes records, and writes `report.txt` — including overdue detection |

> You don't need to finish all topics at once. Submit each one as you complete it by sending your repository link to the chat group.

### Guided Project: Flight Booking Service (if you have no idea)

You will build a backend service that handles flight bookings — step by step across each topic.

#### REST API in Go
Build these 3 endpoints in Go:

**`POST /api/v1/bookings`** — Create a pending booking (locks seats 15 min in Redis, publishes `booking.created`)

<details>
<summary>📥 Request / 📤 Response / ❌ Errors</summary>

**Request Body**

#### Web Security CORS
Add CORS to your API so that only your frontend origin is allowed. Show the difference between a blocked and allowed request.

#### TypeScript with Bun
Build a **Web frontend page** or **CLI tool** using Bun that calls your booking API — typed request/response, no `any`. Then deploy it online so it's publicly accessible.

Pick one and follow the matching path below:

---

**Option A: Web**

An HTML page with a form that submits a booking and shows the response.

- Use `bun build` to bundle TypeScript for the browser
- Copy the output to your Debian VM and let nginx serve it as static files (this will be done together with the Deployment task)

> Once live, your frontend URL becomes your allowed CORS origin. Update your Go API's CORS config to allow it — this is where the CORS task becomes real.

---

**Option B: CLI**

A terminal tool (e.g. `bun run book.ts --flight fl_xxx --seat 14A`) that calls the API and prints the result.

- Run directly with `bun run` — no compile step needed
- Make it installable so others can run it on their machine. Options:
  - **Publish to npm** — `bun publish` then others run `npx your-tool`
  - **Compile to binary** — `bun build --compile book.ts --outfile booking-cli` produces a single executable, share it via GitHub Releases
  - **Install script** — write a `install.sh` that downloads the binary and puts it in `$PATH`

> Goal: someone else should be able to install and run your CLI without cloning your repo.

#### Testing
Write tests for your booking endpoints. You decide how many types of testing to apply — pick what makes sense for your implementation.

**Required cases to cover (regardless of testing type):**
- Happy path — booking created successfully (201)
- Seat conflict — same seat booked twice (409)
- Missing fields — required fields omitted (400)

**Testing types you can choose from:**
- **Unit test** — test handler logic in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Integration test** — test the full request/response cycle against a real DB/Redis
- **Both** — unit for logic, integration for the full flow

> There's no single right answer. Think about what gives you the most confidence that your code works.

#### Deployment on a Linux VM

Deploy your API and frontend on a free cloud Linux VM, managed by systemd, served over HTTPS via nginx.

Any Linux distro that supports systemd works (suggestion: Debian) — pick based on what your cloud provider offers in the free tier.

**Get a free VM:**

| Provider | Free Tier |
|----------|-----------|
| [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) | Always-free AMD VM (no expiry) — best option |
| [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free) | e2-micro in US regions — always free |
| [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) | t2.micro — free for 12 months |
| [Linode/Akamai](https://www.linode.com/lp/free-credit/) | $100 credit for new accounts |
| [Civo](https://www.civo.com/) | $250 credit for new accounts |

**What to set up on the VM:**
1. Install your Linux distro of choice, Go, and nginx
2. Run your **Go API** as a systemd service — auto-starts on boot, auto-restarts on crash
3. Build your **frontend** with `bun build` and serve the static files via nginx (if Web), or skip if CLI
4. Configure **nginx** as a reverse proxy in front of the API (and static files for Web)
5. Enable **HTTPS** with Let's Encrypt via `certbot` — free SSL certificate

**Domain for HTTPS:**
- **Have your own domain?** Point it to your VM IP and use it — Let's Encrypt will issue a cert for it via `certbot`
- **No domain?** Use `sslip.io` — a free wildcard DNS that maps any IP to a domain, no registration needed. If your VM IP is `1.2.3.4`, your domain is `1-2-3-4.sslip.io` and certbot works the same way

> Your API and frontend must be reachable over HTTPS from the public internet when done.

---

#### Linux with shell script
Write a shell script that reads booking records from a file, processes them, and writes a summary report.

Your script should be able to:
- **Read** — load `bookings.psv` (pipe-separated, one booking per line)
- **Process** — count bookings by status (`PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, `CANCELLED`), sum total revenue from confirmed bookings, and list any bookings past their `paymentDeadline` that are still `PENDING`
- **Write** — output a `report.txt` with the results in a clean, readable format

Example `bookings.psv` input (pipe-separated):
```
bookingId|pnr|status|totalAmount|currency|paymentDeadline
bk_001|QL3XF7|CONFIRMED|12500.00|THB|2026-04-07T10:15:00Z
bk_002|AB1234|PENDING|8900.00|THB|2026-03-01T10:00:00Z
bk_003|ZX9900|CANCELLED|5000.00|THB|2026-04-10T08:00:00Z
```

Example `report.txt` output:
```
=== Booking Report (generated: 2026-04-20 09:00:00) ===

Status Summary:
  CONFIRMED : 1
  PENDING   : 1
  CANCELLED : 1

Total Revenue (CONFIRMED): 12500.00 THB

Expired PENDING Bookings (payment overdue):
  bk_002  AB1234  deadline: 2026-03-01T10:00:00Z
```

**Hint:** Use `awk -F'|'` to parse fields, `date -u +%s` to convert timestamps to Unix epoch for comparison, and redirect output with `>` to write the report file. No external tools needed — pure shell.
